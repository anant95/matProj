# matProj
parallely perform matrix multiplication in two different system 
1-Two matrix mat1[m][n] and mat2[n][q]
2-Server read from a text file test.txt which contain value of m,n,n,q and then both matrix
3-server send mat1 to both the clientOne and clientTwo
4-now server send one column to clientOne and next column to clientTwo of mat2
5-clientOne and clientTwo perform maltiplication on the matrix they got with the mat1
6-they both send result back to server
